     <h1>Hi Asha!</h1>
     <p>Happy special birthday! Today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence.
In the journey of life, I am grateful to have you by my side.
<br><br>
Between seas, galaxies, and moons, I was lucky I stepped on the same land, I dreamed under the same stars as you.
<br><br>
We've traversed oceans of memories, ventured through galaxies of experiences, and basked beneath the beauty of moons together. I feel incredibly fortunate to share unforgettable adventures with you.
<br><br>
Every step we take together is a part of the journey that shapes our unique story. Your smile Illuminates each day, adding warmth to the surroundings.
<br><br>
May this year be a chapter filled with happiness, succes, and love. Thank you for being a part of my life's story. Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with extraordinary joy and achievments! <3 <!p>
